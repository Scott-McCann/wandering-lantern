What about this website sounds useful to you?

"Something that allows quick and easy Character set up for homebrew games,
 with a dynamic character sheet and inventory management sounds awesome.
Being able to store and share custom classes and stuff would be neat too."

Why?

"Anything to reduce set-up time, and make it easier for new players."

Is there anything you would like to be added to this project?

"I'd like to see, an initiative tracker and other DM tools like encounter creation."

"I want to be able to print out a character sheet, and cards for feats and spells."

What do you use now, and how does that working for you?

"Right now I use about 3 apps to store homebrew items and monsters,
 but I can't share that with my friends."

What about this website sounds useful to you?

"Inventory management would be great, and a better way to share
 homebrew content is sorely needed."

Why?

"Writing down and managing inventory is tedious, Especially at higher levels.
 Plus my handwriting is terrible. Not having to do it would be nice."

 Is there anything that you would like to see added to this project?

"Tokens. Being able to print out tokens for all the items would be awesome."

What do you use now, and how is that working for?

"Most of the Homebrew community is scattered across many website and forums.
It's hard to find good well balanced material. Most of the apps allow you to create custom items and things, but none of them really let you share that. Most of the time you cant even save them. "
